Travel Director
- ""The trick to really connecting with the Greeks is to say 'Kalimera!' (Good morning!) loud and proud to everyone you meet each morning, as we do, and to relax long enough to let your sense of humour come though. The Greeks appreciate people who lay the cards on the table, are authentic and show interest in the places they visit. ""
- ""I love how guests react to hearing the Zorba the Greek song. It’s amazing that one old song can still unite and spread so much enthusiasm.""
- ""In Greece, we still break plates when we are excited, happy, dancing, celebrating our namedays or birthdays, get married or divorced!""","Authentic Dining

Travel Director
- ""One of the places I love to take our guests to that they would likely not find on their own or when travelling with anyone else is Nafplion, Greece. It's a beautiful seaside town with traditional Neoclassical buildings. I think it's the most charming town on the mainland of Greece.""
- ""I love how guests react to hearing the Zorba the Greek song. It’s amazing that one old song can still unite and spread so much enthusiasm.""
- ""The trick to really connecting with the Greeks is to say 'Kalimera!' (Good morning!) loud and proud to everyone you meet each morning, as we do, and to relax long enough to let your sense of humour come though. The Greeks appreciate people who lay the cards on the table, are authentic and show interest in the places they visit. ""

**Your journey takes you to: Xi’an, China – Beijing – Juyongguan – Hangzhou – Suzhou – Shanghai – Kobe, Japan – Osaka – Tokyo – Shanghai, China.**","Gaze in wonder upon the terracotta warriors of Xi'an
After 2,200-odd years underground, the unearthing of this archaeological wonder was entirely unexpected. While drilling a well in 1974, workers accidentally discovered a cavernous vault filled with thousands of terracotta soldiers positioned for battle. Alongside their sculpted steeds, each soldier’s face is unique and the army comprises of archers, swordsmen, wooden chariots and more. Believed to be the work of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, this undocumented vanguard have stood watch over his nearby tomb in stony silence for millennia.

On your visit to the site, observe the high-ranking officers of Pit 3, then get up close and personal with five of the soldiers in Pit 2, including a cavalryman, a kneeling archer, standing archer, an officer and a general. Finally, stand in stunned silence as you observe the 2,000 displayed warriors of Pit 3. Unlike anything else on earth, this subterranean display of military might is a humbling reminder of the dynastic grandeur of ancient China.

Travel Director
- ""I love to see how guests respond to Rotterdam, because it confounds their expectations. The wacky modern architecture of the Markthal (shaped like a giant horseshoe), the world-famous “tilting” Cube Houses and aptly nicknamed “pencil case"" make for wonderful, quirky photo souvenirs. This bustling port city is such a contrast to anything that they experienced - even the views from our hotel to the Ersamus Bridge are a delight to the eye.""
- ""It's magical to see how a group of guests comes together over the course of our trip. I can always tell when that's happening because suddenly the enthusiasm is palpable.""
- ""I decided to become a Travel Director because I love the joy of discovery. When people see a place they've dreamed about, tasted something they've only read about, and hear the music and stories of a place they're exploring, we all share a joyful creation of lifelong memories.""

Jumping into a jet boat, you’ll get right in the thundering thick of it as you approach Huka Falls, feeling the buffeting force of 220,000 litres of water per second as you gaze in awe.

Iconic Experience
- Rio de Janeiro: Journey high above Guanabara Bay first to Urca hill and then the top of Sugarloaf at 1,299 feet above sea level for views of Botafogo cove, Copacabana, and Guanabara Bay. Take in all the dramatic views with plenty of photos knowing you’re a part of history. This Cable Car linking Urca hill to Sugarloaf Mountain built in 1912 was the first Brazilian cable car and the third in the world. You’ll also learn the story of the name Sugarloaf, the most popular version saying that from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, at the peak of sugar cane production, the mounds of refined sugar resembled the shape of the mountain itself. A sweet story with a stunning view.
- Corcovado: Climb into the clouds to the top of Corcovado Mountain to visit the iconic Christ the Redeemer. You’ll ride the Corcovado Railway, the first electrified railroad in Brazil, and an icon itself. The railway is actually older than the monument and even transported the pieces of the monument. The train has taken popes, kings, princes, presidents, artists, scientists - and now you - since its start in 1884. You’ll feel good about your travels too knowing that this electric train doesn’t pollute the surrounding Tijuca National Park. As you ascend 2,379 feet, consider the history of Christ the Redeemer built from 1926-1931, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and one of the most famous Art Déco sculptures. Gaze out the window at the views of the Rio de Janeiro and, at the top, stand beneath the famous statue’s feet looking up to its top of 98 feet high.
- Iguassu Falls: Join a Local Specialist who will guide your exploration of the Brazilian side of the falls in this massive park spanning the border between Argentina and Brazil. The region hosts a variety of wildlife including tapirs, giant anteaters, howler monkeys, ocelots, jaguars, caymans and 400 species of birds - so be on the lookout for that special photo-op. Given Iguassu’s support of extreme habitats and diverse species, it’s no wonder it is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
- Iguassu Falls: Join a local specialist for a walk along the long catwalk suspended above the swirling waters of the Iguassu River. View the chaotic crush of water pouring down Devil's throat falls. Then board an open-air ecological jungle train for a different perspective of the mighty cascades.
- Buenos Aires: Embark on a Buenos Aires City Tour with a Local Specialist. Walk through the wide boulevards of this beautiful capital admiring the spirit of a city whose European and Latin American influences can be seen around every turn. See the pink palace, the seat of the Argentine national government and president's office whose balcony Juan and “Evita” Perón addressed the people in the 1940s and 1950s. Visit the cathedral and wander through the lively and colorful La Boca neighborhood lined with restaurants, street artists and local art around every corner.","Dining Highlights

- ""One of the places I love to take our guests to that they would likely not find on their own or when travelling with anyone else is Nafplion, Greece. It's a beautiful seaside town with traditional Neoclassical buildings. I think it's the most charming town on the mainland of Greece.""
- ""I love how guests react to hearing the Zorba the Greek song. It’s amazing that one old song can still unite and spread so much enthusiasm.""
- ""The trick to really connecting with the Greeks is to say 'Kalimera!' (Good morning!) loud and proud to everyone you meet each morning, as we do, and to relax long enough to let your sense of humour come though. The Greeks appreciate people who lay the cards on the table, are authentic and show interest in the places they visit. ""

After 2,200-odd years underground, the unearthing of this archaeological wonder was entirely unexpected. While drilling a well in 1974, workers accidentally discovered a cavernous vault filled with thousands of terracotta soldiers positioned for battle. Alongside their sculpted steeds, each soldier’s face is unique and the army comprises of archers, swordsmen, wooden chariots and more. Believed to be the work of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, this undocumented vanguard have stood watch over his nearby tomb in stony silence for millennia.

On your visit to the site, observe the high-ranking officers of Pit 3, then get up close and personal with five of the soldiers in Pit 2, including a cavalryman, a kneeling archer, standing archer, an officer and a general.

Travel Director
- ""The trick to really connecting with the Greeks is to say 'Kalimera!' (Good morning!) loud and proud to everyone you meet each morning, as we do, and to relax long enough to let your sense of humour come though. The Greeks appreciate people who lay the cards on the table, are authentic and show interest in the places they visit. ""
- ""I love how guests react to hearing the Zorba the Greek song. It’s amazing that one old song can still unite and spread so much enthusiasm.""
- ""In Greece, we still break plates when we are excited, happy, dancing, celebrating our namedays or birthdays, get married or divorced!""

After 2,200-odd years underground, the unearthing of this archaeological wonder was entirely unexpected. While drilling a well in 1974, workers accidentally discovered a cavernous vault filled with thousands of terracotta soldiers positioned for battle. Alongside their sculpted steeds, each soldier’s face is unique and the army comprises of archers, swordsmen, wooden chariots and more. Believed to be the work of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, this undocumented vanguard have stood watch over his nearby tomb in stony silence for millennia.

On your visit to the site, observe the high-ranking officers of Pit 3, then get up close and personal with five of the soldiers in Pit 2, including a cavalryman, a kneeling archer, standing archer, an officer and a general. Finally, stand in stunned silence as you observe the 2,000 displayed warriors of Pit 3.
